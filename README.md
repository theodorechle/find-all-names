Useless script who search names of all variables, objects, functions and others.
You can do the same thing by print globals() or locals().
Launch find_all_names with an argument who is the maximal number of caracters in the name.
WARNING : The more characters it looks for, the longer it will take ! -> Since 4 or 5 caracters, it will be very very long (hours, days or even more).
